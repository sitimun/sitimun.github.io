# Boss Exchange

Boss Exchange is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange.

# What is Boss Exchange?
dhopakexchange currently acts as an open source, updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development team. Although dhopakexchange started as a fork of EtherDelta, considerable development time has been put towards a new token listing system, order book, API, and front-end UI all of which are at different stages of development and can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/forkdelta/). 

# How does Boss Exchange Work?
dhopakexchange currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows dhopakexchange users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume.

# What is the Roadmap for Boss Exchange?

As this is a project by the community, for the community, transactions to and from the donations address will be public and can be viewed on the blockchain. We will also keep a public ledger of how the donations are distributed. That way, donors can see exactly how their donations are helping!
